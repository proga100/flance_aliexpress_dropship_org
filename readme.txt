== Description ==
The plugin gives functionality to have the form to add multiple products to the cart and calculate in same page the total 
price of the order.
And you also can use shortcode to use the plugin other places. Just place the shortcode where 
you wanna put the input form and it's done !!!

= Features =

= Shortcode =

[flance_products_form product_ids=99,96,93 prod_cat=15]
product_ids is Product ids to show in form.
prod_cat is Products Category Id to show the product from the category in the form.

Comment: Shortcode parameter product_ids is prioritized. Which means that if we have two parameters in shortcode
like [flance_products_form product_ids=99,96,93 prod_cat=15 ] the products with ids 99,96,93 will be shown in the form.
Therefore, if you want to show the products from category you should not use the parameter product_ids.
form id can be added by parameter form_id example [flance_products_form product_ids=99,96,93 form_id=1 ]
